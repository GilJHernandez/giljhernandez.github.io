1. Titration Expert: Quantitative analysis taught me the way of the buret. I can titrate acids/redox/complexes and get concentrations from everything inside of them.
2. Rotovap Novice: Organic chemistry showed me how to purify aqueous samples with this really cool looking piece of equipment I can't wait to use it more.
3. Gravimetric Analyzer: Turning mass into concentration isn't as hard as it sounds, this should be very useful in later lab sections.
4. Magnetic Stir Master: Of all the times using magnetic stir I haven't spilled anything with it, hoping to keep that streak alive in the future.
