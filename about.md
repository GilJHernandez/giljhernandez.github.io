Hi! I'm Gil a prospective polymer and coating lab member hoping to work on intersting projects and expand my knowledge in the world of biology and chemistry. I'm from Northern California but I've been all over the world, I love learning about new cultures and experiences. I always find myself eager to get my hands dirty and am always open to learning new skills in any field.

### More Information

When I'm not doing something very serious you can find me out at the beach surfing or behind my monitor playing some video games. I like to put things together and spend time outside with my dog. It's a boxer if you were wondering.
