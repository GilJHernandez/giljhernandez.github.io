title: Experiences of an Amateur Web Developer
---
This project has given me more respect for people in the web development and computer science field than I ever thought I was going to have. It was a very interesting project getting to learn basic logic and coding methods that could help put together a basic website to put information of myself on but it was tough getting everything done correctly. Coding and development takes a lot of scrutiny and a good eye for details that could possibly break your entire priject just from one line of code or a single character. But after many 404 errors and some light bug squashing I made a competent website and am very proud that I did. In the future I will continue to improve my web presence with more professional items but for now the experience of web development was a valuable one.
