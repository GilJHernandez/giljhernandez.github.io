Gilberto Hernandez: Not much of a research group her yet but I'm hoping to grow that with more experience and related projects in the future. For now I am an eager and curious researcher with a passion for extremely clean lab glass. I find it satisfying. The more time with interesting instruments the better, I'll learn how to use anything with enough time and probably figure out how to fix it. Mechanically minded and able to use those skills to an advantage.
